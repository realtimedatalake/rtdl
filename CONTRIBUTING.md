# Contributing

Thanks for choosing to contribute!

The following are a set of guidelines to follow when contributing to this project.


## Code Of Conduct

This project adheres to the rtdl [code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) - a 
direct adaptation of the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), 
version [2.1](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.html). 
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report 
unacceptable behavior to [gavin@rtdl.com](mailto:gavin@rtdl.com).


## Have A Question?

Start by filing an issue. The existing committers on this project work to reach
consensus around project direction and issue solutions within issue threads
(when appropriate).


## Developer Certificate of Origin

rtdl is an open source product released under the MIT license 
(see the [LICENSE file](./LICENSE)). The MIT license allows you to 
freely use, modify, distribute, and sell your own products that include 
MIT licensed software.

We respect intellectual property rights of others and we want to make 
sure all incoming contributions are correctly attributed and licensed. 
A Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) is a lightweight mechanism to 
do that.

The DCO is a declaration attached to every contribution made by every 
developer. In the commit message of the contribution, the developer 
simply adds a `Signed-off-by` statement and thereby agrees to the DCO, 
which you can find below or at [developercertificate.org](http://developercertificate.org/).

```
Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
    have the right to submit it under the open source license
    indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
    by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
    in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
    it.

(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
    are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
    personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
    maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
    this project or the open source license(s) involved.

```
We require that every contribution to rtdl is signed with a DCO. 
Additionally, please use your real name. We do not accept anonymous 
contributors nor those utilizing pseudonyms.

Each commit must include a DCO which looks like this

```
Signed-off-by: Jane Smith <jane.smith@email.com>
```
You may type this line on your own when writing your commit messages. 
However, if your user.name and user.email are set in your git configs, 
you can use `-s` or `--signoff` to add the `Signed-off-by` line to the 
end of the commit message.


## Code Reviews

All submissions should come in the form of pull requests and need to be reviewed
by project committers. Read [GitHub's pull request documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)
for more information on sending pull requests.
