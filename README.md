[rtdl](https://rtdl.io) makes it easy to build and maintain a real-time data lake. You send rtdl 
a real-time data stream ‚Äì often from a tool like Kafka or Segment ‚Äì and it builds you a real-time 
data lake in Parquet format that automatically works with [Dremio](https://www.dremio.com/) to 
give you access to your real-time data in popular BI and ML tools ‚Äì just like a data warehouse. 
rtdl can build your real-time data lake on AWS S3, GCP Cloud Storage, and Azure Blob Storage.  
  
You provide the streams, rtdl builds your data lake.  
  
Stay up-to-date on rtdl via our [website](https://rtdl.io/) and [blog](https://rtdl.io/blog/), 
and learn how to use rtdl via our [documentation](https://rtdl.io/docs/).


## V0.1.1 - Current status -- what works and what doesn't

### What works? üöÄ
rtdl's initial feature set is built and working. You can use the API on port 80 to 
configure streams that ingest json from an rtdl endpoint on port 8080, process them into Parquet, 
and save the files to a destination configured in your stream. rtdl can write files locally, to 
AWS S3, GCP Cloud Storage, and Azure Blob Storage and you can query your data via Dremio's web UI
at http://localhost:9047 (login with Username: `rtdl` and Password `rtdl1234`).

### What's new? üí•
  * Replaced Kafka & Zookeeper with [Redpanda](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda).
  * Added support for HDFS.
  * Fixed issue with handling booleans when writing Parquet.
  * Added several logo variants and a banner to the public directory.

### What doesn't work/what's next on the roadmap? üö¥üèº  
  * [Dremio Cloud](https://www.dremio.com/platform/cloud/) support.
  * Apache Hudi support.
  * Start using GitHub Projects for work tracking.
  * Research and implementation for Apache Iceberg, Delta Lake, and Project Nessie.
  * Community contribution: Stateful Function for PII detection and masking.
  * Graphical user interface.
  

## Quickstart üå±
### Initialize and start rtdl
For more detailed instructions, see our [Initialize rtdl docs](https://rtdl.io/docs/setting-up/initializertdl).
1.  Run `docker compose -f docker-compose.init.yml up -d`.
    * **Note:** This configuration should be fault-tolerant, but if any containers or 
      processes fail when running this, run `docker compose -f docker-compose.init.yml down` 
      and retry.
2.  After the containers `rtdl_rtdl-db-init`, `rtdl_dremio-init`, and `rtdl_redpanda-init` exit and complete 
    with `EXITED (0)`, kill and delete the rtdl container set by running 
    `docker compose -f docker-compose.init.yml down`.
3.  Run `docker compose up -d` every time after.  
    **Note:** Your memory setting in Docker must be at least 8GB. rtdl may become unstable if it is 
    set lower.
    * `docker compose down` to stop.

**Note #1:** To start from scratch, run `rm -rf storage/` from the rtdl root folder.  
**Note #2:** If you experience file write issues preventing Dremio and/or Redpanda services 
from starting, please add `user: root` to the `docker-compose.init.yml` and `docker-compose.yml` 
files in the Dremio and Redpanda service definitions. This issue has been encountered on Linux.

### Setup your storage buckets (in AWS) and stream in rtdl
For more detailed setup instructions for your cloud provider, see our setup docs:
  * [Setup with AWS](https://rtdl.io/docs/setting-up/setupwithaws).
  * [Setup with GCP](https://rtdl.io/docs/setting-up/setupwithgcp).
  * [Setup with Azure](https://rtdl.io/docs/setting-up/setupwithazure).

1.  Create a new S3 bucket.
    * For more information, see [Amazon‚Äôs documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/creating-bucket.html).
2.  Create a new IAM user.
    * For more information, see [Amazon‚Äôs documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html#id_users_create_console).
3.  Create a IAM new policy.
    * Use the below permissions, and attach the policy to the IAM 
      user created in step 2. Replace `<YOUR_BUCKET_NAME>` with the 
      name of the S3 bucket you created in step 1.
      ```

                  "Resource": [
                      "arn:aws:s3:::*"
                  ]
              },
              {

                  ],
                  "Resource": [
                      "arn:aws:s3:::<YOUR_BUCKET_NAME>"
                  ]
              },
              {
                  "Sid": "ManageBucket",
                  "Effect": "Allow",

                      "s3:DeleteObject"
                  ],
                  "Resource": [
                      "arn:aws:s3:::<YOUR_BUCKET_NAME>/*"
                  ]
              }
          ]
      }
      ```
  5.  Attach the policy created in step 3 to the IAM user created in step 2.
  6.  Create access keys for your IAM user.
      * For more information, see [Amazon's documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html#Using_CreateAccessKey).
      * Save the `Access Key ID` and `Secret Access Key` for use in configuring your stream in rtdl.
  7.  Create a stream configuration record in rtdl.  
      Send a call to the API at http://localhost:80/createStream.
      * Example `createStream` call body for creating a data lake on AWS S3.  
        ```
        {
        "active": true,
        "message_type": "test-msg-aws",
        "file_store_type_id": 2,
        "region": "us-west-1",
        "bucket_name": "testBucketAWS",
        "folder_name": "testFolderAWS",
        "partition_time_id": 1,
        "compression_type_id": 1,
        "aws_access_key_id": "[aws_access_key_id]",
        "aws_secret_access_key": "[aws_secret_access_key]"
        }
        ```
      * Example `createStream` curl call for creating a data lake on AWS S3.  
        ```
        curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:80/createStream' \
        --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        --data-raw '{
        "active": true,
        "message_type": "test-msg-aws",
        "file_store_type_id": 2,
        "region": "us-west-1",
        "bucket_name": "testBucketAWS",
        "folder_name": "testFolderAWS",
        "partition_time_id": 1,
        "compression_type_id": 1,
        "aws_access_key_id": "[aws_access_key_id]",
        "aws_secret_access_key": "[aws_secret_access_key]"
        }'
        ```
      **Note:** A Postman collection with examples of all rtdl API calls can be found on GitHub at [realtimedatalake/postman-rtdl-public](https://github.com/realtimedatalake/postman-rtdl-public).  

### Send data to rtdl
For more detailed instructions, see our [Send data to rtdl docs](https://rtdl.io/docs/setting-up/senddata).  
All data should be sent to the `ingest` endpoint of the ingest service on port 8080 -- e.g. http://localhost:8080/ingest.
*   You can send ***any*** json with just ```stream_id``` in the payload and rtdl will add it to your lake.
    ```
    {
        "stream_id":"837a8d07-cd06-4e17-bcd8-aef0b5e48d31",
        "name":"user1",
        "array":[1,2,3],
        "properties":{"age":20}
    }
    ```  
	You can optionally add ```message_type``` should you choose to override the ```message_type``` specified while creating the stream.
	rtdl will default to a message type ```rtdl_default``` if message type is absent in both stream definition and actual message.


## Architecture üèõ
rtdl has a multi-service architecture composed of a new generation of open source tools 
to process and access your data and custom-built services to interact with them more easily. 
To learn more about rtdl's services and architecture, visit our 
[Architecture docs](https://rtdl.io/docs/architecture).
